Cellphone radiation is real. Here are five ways to protect yourself.,"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones

tl;dr, the only known affect of non-ionizing radiation is heating.  It's not linked to cancer the way ionizing radiation is.

Cellphones emit non-ionizing radiation only.  In fact, the radiation emitted by a cellphone is generally between 16cm and 42cm.  Whereas light needs to be at around 200nm to do damage, or around 1 million times more energetic.

They have to be this weak in order to be useful, only visible light and radio waves can punch through the atmosphere.  For comparison, visible light ranges from 750-350nm, and we receive far more of it and radio waves from the sun than from our cellphones."

Cellphone radiation is real. Here are five ways to protect yourself.,"An initial problem with the article is the use of the blanket term 'radiation'. It's a nice scary word in a world terrified by nuclear weapons and power plant meltdowns, but it's a bit like saying 'food will make you fat!'. What kind of food? How much? How often? Does simply walking into your kitchen immediately turn you into a balloon? What about if you eat a few biscuits a day? A week?

A number of different organisations have studied the potential dangers of cellphone emissions, and the results have been indecisive at best.

As for the 5 suggestions... well, they're functionally reasonable if one assumes that one's phone is in fact dangerously radioactive, but they render the phone barely usable. Might as well add:

6) Submerge the phone in the center of a swimming pool. Water is very resistant to many forms of radiation, and this approach is used by all nuclear power plants to control radiation."

Does simply walking into your kitchen immediately turn you into a balloon? What about if you eat a few biscuits a day? A week?

A number of different organisations have studied the potential dangers of cellphone emissions, and the results have been indecisive at best.

As for the 5 suggestions... well, they're functionally reasonable if one assumes that one's phone is in fact dangerously radioactive, but they render the phone barely usable. Might as well add:

Water is very resistant to many forms of radiation, and this approach is used by all nuclear power plants to control radiation.","An initial problem with the article is the use of the blanket term 'radiation'.

Cellphone radiation is real. Here are five ways to protect yourself.,"Ever heard of  radiator? why was no one afraid of this, despite it being invented appx 1856 and the atomic age began in 1945?

Radiators heated up our homes, but had no one railing against the dangerous gamma waves or beta particles coming out of it, despite it having RADIATION in the NAME. why?

Because it is somehow understood with that, but not cell phones, microwaves, or tvs, that radiation is the act of giving off a form of energy. the way YOU RADIATE HEAT every day, or lightbulbs RADIATE light upon you. The light is given off and spreads throughout the room.

Debunk this: Six Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America,"I can't believe people are missing the two obvious flaws in this analysis. This infographic doesn't show that 6 companies control 90% of the media. It doesn't provide any basis for the 90% figure. That's just a number pulled out of the air. All it shows is that 6 companies create and/or distribute a lot of media content. 

There are other problems, too. I will update this when I get a few minutes to expand on it. 

EDIT: Ok, let's explore why this graphic is partly true, partly false and partly misleading. This isn't a comprehensive examination, just a look at some problems that stood out to me.

&gt; *“Media has never been more consolidated. 6 media giants now control a staggering 90% of what we read, watch or listen to.”*

The most fundamental problem is here. They give the numerator (the 6 media giants and the media they create or distribute), but never give the denominator (the total amount of media Americans consume). In fact, the infographic seems to suggest that it is basically just comparing ownership of the largest media outlets in 1983 to ownership of those same outlets today....as if media consumption today is, apart from ownership, the same as it was in 1983.  

*&gt; ""232 Media executives control the information diet of 277 million Americans""*

Where do these numbers come from?  How does he arrive at 232 media executives? What constitutes ""executive"" or ""control"" or an executive with control? The infographic does not explain. These are just numbers thrown out without any context or apparent methodology. 


The infographic says the Comcast/NBC merger guarantees ""monopoly of 11 US markets like NYC and Chicago."" I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean. Comcast is not the only provider in NYC or Chicago, and NBCUniversal was not the only cable channel/content producer/network, so in what sense did the merger create a ""monopoly"" in 11 markets?  

*&gt; ""In 1995, the FCC forbade companies ownership of more than 40 stations. Clear Channel Communications now owns over 1,500.""*

In 1996, Congress updated the Communications Act and eased ownership restrictions. As a result, some companies started buying a lot of radio stations. Many of those companies are now struggling to stay afloat, because radio audiences have cratered due to the rise of things like the iPod, satellite radio and the Internet. 

But, you argue, maybe radio would be doing better if it was still locally owned instead of owned by big chains. That's a valid hypothesis. Unfortunately, locally owned and operated radio stations are not doing particularly well, either. The entire industry is struggling. The ability to achieve economies of scale has helped many radio stations that would otherwise be even further underwater. This benefit, however, is balanced against the tremendous debt burden that ClearChannel and other big companies took on when buying up stations.

In any event, ""80% of stations' playlists match"" because people are mostly the same everywhere. As exotic as those yankees/southerners/west coasters/midwesterners/people from Florida may seem to us, folks in other parts of the United States really aren't *all* that different.  Well, maybe people from Florida are, but the rest of us are pretty similar. There are some differences, which is why some areas have more country/rap/alternative/jazz/classical stations than others, but people who like classic rock mostly like the same bands and songs. People who like top 40 mostly like the same bands and songs.  

Radio stations do extensive audience testing to determine their playlists, to measure what songs are getting ""burned"" and what songs audiences like (or might like). There are some regional differences, but people mostly like the same things. People in radio often hear outsiders who are certain they know what the station should do differently -- more new music, more variety, whatever -- and, frankly, many radio people would prefer their stations had more variety and were more inventive. But you know what? They also realize that what people say they want and what people *actually listen to* are two pretty different things. If ""more new music/more variety"" worked consistently, radio stations would do that, because money. 

*&gt; ""The Big Six's box office sales hit $7 billion in 2010, that's 2X the box office sales of the next 140 Studios*""

Wait, earlier the infographic were talking about how a few media giants ""control"" the media by owning everything.  But this is a different claim. This claims that the few media giants are just *more successful* than ""the next 140 studios"". If there are 146 studios, then it sounds like there's a lot of competition to produce content and people just prefer the content produced by the ""Big 6""....or, in reality, produced by one of many, many other studios and bought by the ""Big 6"" for distribution. 

And finally, the infographic closes with this dire warning: ""Until regulations return (or they buy each other out of existence), they will continue to control 90% of everything Americans see, hear and consider important.""

Sounds serious, right? Now consider what some of the ""media consolidation"" Pollyanna's [were saying 15 years ago](https://transition.fcc.gov/ownership/roundtable_docs/cooper-a.pdf). 

&gt; ""The Internet has not yet evolved into a ubiquitous mass communications medium that can challenge the other media.""

Yeah? How are those radio stations, newspapers and magazines holding up these days? 

&gt; ""The increasing concentration of the Internet is stunning. AOL's dominance of subscribership in the U.S. is widely noted ... Even more striking is the growth in the concentration of usage. Because the number of potential online channels is infinite, some assume that market dominance is an impossibility on the Internet. This is faulty reasoning. ... Analysis of Media Metrix data over the past three years shows an incontrovertible trend toward online media consolidation…. Between March 1999 and March 2001, the total number of companies controlling 50 percent of user minutes online decreased by nearly two-thirds, from 11 to four. Because AOL has such a dominant position (over 30 percent of user time) the HHI is about 1200, well above the moderately concentrated threshold. The four firm concentration ratio also falls in the range where concerns about concentration and the abuse of market power begin. 

Yes, 15 years ago they were Deeply Concerned that a few companies, mainly AOL, would ""control"" online media.  Shortly thereafter, AOL collapsed, Google and Facebook rose and every asshole with a Twitter account became their own media provider. 

There are big media companies. There always have been. We'll be fine. 

In the meantime, giving government more power over the media will not make things better.

Divestiture of media and divestiture of finance (banks in particular) are *just* what this country needs.","&gt; That's speculation on your part

It is based on the fact that radio stations are struggling all over the country. There are obviously stations making a great deal of money, especially in large markets, but there are a lot of stations that are barely staying afloat whether they are locally or nationally owned.  In fact, many locally owned stations had to sell to the national chains many years ago because they simply didn't have the resources to compete. 

&gt; Let the market decide what happens to each station individually. A station that doesn't serve it's market well may serve a different market simply by changing format. 

Yeah, that's how it works no matter who owns the radio stations. ClearChannel, Cumulus, Infinity...they will change the format in a heartbeat if they think the market will better support a different format. 

&gt; Solutions to the radio industry's financial problems shouldn't come at the expense of a free press and a healthy Democracy.

I'm pretty skeptical that the identity of the owner of Hot 104.5 is a critical element in maintaining our democracy. Whether it is owned by ClearChannel or by the local Smith family does not make *that* big a difference in the programming of the radio station. Both of them are trying to maximize profitability and that means adopting whatever research, experts and program directors tell them is most likely to succeed. &gt;If ClearChannel divested itself of every radio station it owned AND those radio stations were bought by local owners, they would still struggle.

That's speculation on your part, and something that CAN NOT be generalized. Some markets are thriving, some are floundering. Let the market decide what happens to each station individually. A station that doesn't serve it's market well may serve a different market simply by changing format. Competition and diversity are what make for a healthy market place.

&gt;Divestiture isn't a solution to the problems the entire radio industry faces.

That's wholly irrelevant to a discussion about consolidated media's  detrimental effects on Democracy.

Solutions to the radio industry's financial problems shouldn't come at the expense of a free press and a healthy Democracy. Debunk this: Six Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America"

I don't know if /r/geology is a thing or if that would even be the right place to go, but it's worth a shot.

Keep us updated, I'm interested to find out what these are. i was wondering if anyone have heard of it, from a valid source.

debunk this : ancient ruins found in antarctica,"Our species is very young, and no part of Antarctica has been habitable by humans within the timeframe of the entire existence of our species. It is literally impossible for there to be 'ancient' human settlements on that continent. Visitations, maybe, though I'd call even that unlikely before relatively modern times, and they'd have to leave much more spare traces, and in nearly all cases and evidence would have been destroyed long ago by the very harsh conditions there.

What *is* true, however, is that 'lost' Antarctic expeditions of the much more recent path -- we're talking more like a century ago -- *have* been sometimes found there, including fairly recently. Because just getting there is such an enormous undertaking, we at least know that they *went* there, even if we don't know what became of them. There haven't been many such expeditions, however, so it's not like there are numerous lost artefacts to be found. Maybe half a dozen at most not already located.

It is much older than that, and like other ancient sites (Ollantaytambo, Easter Island etc) was inherited/appropriated by a later civilization which didn't have the same knowledge or such sophisticated technology to create these sites.","So one line of evidence related to water erosion vs. literally all of the historical and archaeological evidence suggesting that the Sphinx is part of Old Kingdom Egypt? This gets trotted out every time because this is literally ALL you have. Next you'll just write ""Gobekle Tepe"" or ""Comet Impacts"" as if these phrases suffice for evidence of Hancock's extraordinary claims. What are the predictions of his global civilization hypothesis? This isn't science; it's cherry-picking.

Also, ""out of Africa"" is not being debunked. Just because anatomically modern humans interbred slightly with other species does not mean that modern humans did not originate in Africa. From geological evidence of erosion on the Great Sphinx to $URL$. He's been proven right numerous times and more will come out. 

You can bet on that. The gatekeepers are losing their shit. Even the ""out of Africa"" theory is being debunked as we speak. I hope you and others truly have the mental fortitude for when it happens. Something tells me, you will fight tooth and nail defending Zahi Hawass until the end. Sad. Great Pyramid of Giza can focus electromagnetic energy through its hidden chambers"
